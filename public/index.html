    <ul><strong>What Went Well:</strong>
      <br>
      <li>Managing our app's deployment to Heroku, including setting up the database on Heroku.</li>
      <li>Implementing the animation libraries, especially particles.js and animate.css. My curiosity with animation effects (css and javascript) has been growing lately.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <ul><strong>What Did not go well:</strong>
      <br>
      <li>Group dynamics. I worked really well with one team member (Jordan) but I could have been a more direct communicator with another. Especialy when the other team member went off track on a particlar feature, I should have stopped that person right
        there. As a result, the rest of us had to scramble the last day to get that fearture to work (and it was Jordan who did that).</li>
      <li>I initially set up the models but some code had to be refactored. I need to get better at optimizing Sequelize.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <ul><strong>What can I improve for next time:</strong>
      <br>
      <li>I want to get better at back-end, particlarly coding routes. Jordan was the star and solved many of the back-end problems we were facing. I want to be that effective in coding routes for my next project.</li>
